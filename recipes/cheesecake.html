    <h3>A Delicious Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>This dish is a timeless classic that I'll never feel guilty about eating. There is something about perfectly golden 
        crust and the strawberry topping that makes this dessert flawless. I am always craving cheesecake and my boyfriend
        is always debating buying it in stores,so it is high time where I take the time to make it myself. Now I am not a 
        baker at any means, so I was really looking for a recipes that would let me follow relatively easily.

    <p>Look at it! It looks so simple but so delicious!!!</p>
