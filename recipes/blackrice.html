    <h3>Comfort dessert at its finest</h3>
    <p>This dessert is a strange, but beloved one. I remember my mother making this when I was younger
        and it just reminds me of the good ol' times. This rice dessert is sweet and comforting at the same time.
        The splash of coconut just makes it 100 times better as well!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g  (7 oz.) black sticky glutinous rice</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
        <li>2 pandan leaves, tie them into a knot</li>
        <li>Sugar, to taste</li>

    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the black rice into a pot. Rinse with water thoroughly until the water turns clear. Please take note that the color will remain "black" or "purple" in color but it should look clear. Drain the water dry. </li>
        <li>Add the water and Pandan leaves to the rice. Cover the lid and bring to boil on medium to low heat, for about 60 minutes. Lower the heat to simmer and continue to cook until the rice becomes soft and breaks up. Keep checking on the water level, add more water to cook the black sticky rice. Add sugar to taste, stir to combine well. </li>
        <li>While cooking, prepare the coconut milk mixture. Heat up the coconut milk on low heat. Add salt. Stir well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Serve the black sticky rice dessert in small bowls. Top each serving with a spoonful of coconut milk. If you like it creamier, add more coconut milk. Stir well before eating.</li>
